1. Devops lifecycle
======================
1. plan- in this stage planing to business requirment and end-users feedback, and create a project roadmap total planing in this stage
2. code- to give the application to end-users, we first we need code, so with out developers we don't do anything, so developers write the code in this stage
3. build- in this stage, developers complete the task, they commit the code in share reposistories then we take the code, for example java based applications we are using build tools maven
4.test- once build is over, we test the code, so testing purpose we are using lower environments, so here we will check the applications is properly working or not
5. release- once test is completed to deploy on the production environment at this phase. 
6. deploy- in this stage infrastructure as a code helps build the production environment
7. operation- this stage is the release is live now use to customers. The operations team at this stage takes care of server configuring and provisioning using like ansible
8. monitor- ones this are all stages is done, this stage is monitor everything that means collecting the applications data, and monitor entire environment.

2. maven lifecycle:
====================
1. validate- this step is validates if the project structure is correct or not. for example it will check all of the depencies downloaded
2. compile- it compile the source code, converts the .java files to .classes and stores the classed in the target/classed folders   
3. test- it runs unit test for the project
4. package- this step is package the compiled code some format war, ear, or jar
5. install- this step is install the packaged code to the local maven reposistory
6. deploy- it copies to the code to the remote reposistory 

3. linux architecture
======================
in linux archiitecture first have a shell
on shell we are typing the commands
the shell is search to the commands is correct or not and checks syntax
then command is correct it will forword to the kernal
then the kernal is convert to low level language to high level language
